## Storypoints
### User Management


#### As the system owner, I want all users to log in with a unique username and password.
#### As the administrator of the bank, I want to be able to create new users in the system.
#### As the system owner, I want users who fail to log in three times to be locked out of the system.

### Account Information

#### As a user, I want to see a list of all my bank accounts and their balances.
#### As a user, I want to be able to transfer money between two of my accounts.
#### As a user, I want to be able to transfer money to other bank customers.
#### As a user, I want to be able to open new accounts at the bank.
#### As a user, I want to be able to have an account in another currency.
#### As the bank owner, I want transfers between accounts with different currencies to be exchanged according to the current exchange rate, which is updated daily by the administrator.
#### As a user, I want to be able to open a savings account and see what interest rate I can get on it.
#### As a user, I want to be able to borrow money from the bank and see immediately how much interest I will need to pay on the loan.
#### As the bank owner, I want to limit how much each customer can borrow to a maximum of five times the amount they already have with the bank.
#### As a user, I want to be able to view a log of all transfers and transactions that have occurred on my accounts.

### User Experience

#### As the bank owner, I want the app to have an attractive design with clear menus, color schemes, and a nice ASCII-art logo at login.
#### As the bank owner, I want transactions to not happen immediately when users register them, but instead every 15 minutes, for better control.

### Notes

#### Each story point should be assessed and prioritized during sprint planning.
#### Consider breaking larger story points into smaller tasks for more efficient work and clearer responsibility distribution.
